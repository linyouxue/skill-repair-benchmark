name: 13f-analyzer
description: Perform various data analysis on SEC 13-F and obtain some insights of fund activities such as number of holdings, AUM, and change of holdings between two quarters.
---

## Overview

The helper programs are installed under `/skills/13f-analyzer/scripts`. Run them
from that absolute path; the task workspace is normally `/root`, so
`scripts/...` and `/root/scripts/...` are not equivalent paths. If a helper
cannot be found, check `/skills/13f-analyzer/scripts` before writing a replacement
analysis pipeline.

### Analyze the holding summary of a particular fund in one quarter:

```bash
python3 /skills/13f-analyzer/scripts/one_fund_analysis.py \
    --accession_number ... \
    --quarter 2025-q2 \
```

This script will print out several basic information of a given fund on 2025-q2, including total number of holdings, AUM, total number of stock holdings, etc.

Interpret the printed fields precisely:

- `Total AUM` is the fund AUM across all reported holdings.
- `Total number of holdings` counts all reported holding rows.
- `Number of stock holdings` counts rows remaining after the helper's stock
  `TITLEOFCLASS` filter. When a question asks how many stocks the fund holds,
  use this field—not total holdings, `TABLEENTRYTOTAL`, or the number of unique
  CUSIPs.


### Analyze the change of holdings of a particular fund in between two quarters:

```bash
python3 /skills/13f-analyzer/scripts/one_fund_analysis.py \
    --quarter 2025-q3 \
    --accession_number <accession number assigned in q3> \
    --baseline_quarter 2025-q2 \
    --baseline_accession_number <accession number assigned in q2>
```

This script will print out the dynamic changes of holdings from 2025-q2 to 2025-q3.

For cross-quarter **Top Buys / Top Sells**, interpret the output as **dollar value changes per CUSIP** (current quarter VALUE minus baseline quarter VALUE). This is *not* percentage change and is not based on share-count deltas. When asked for "increased investment", rank by the absolute VALUE increase and return the corresponding CUSIPs.

### Analyze which funds hold a stock to the most extent

```bash
python3 /skills/13f-analyzer/scripts/holding_analysis.py \
    --cusip <stock cusip> \
    --quarter 2025-q3 \
    --topk 10
```

This script will print out the top 10 hedge funds who hold a particular stock with highest notional value.
