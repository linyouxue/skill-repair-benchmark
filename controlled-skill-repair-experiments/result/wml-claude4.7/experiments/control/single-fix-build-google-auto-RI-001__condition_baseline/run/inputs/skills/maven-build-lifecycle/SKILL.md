# Maven Build Lifecycle — Legacy CI Repair Workflow

## Maven Invoker failures: debug the nested project, not just the reactor

`maven-invoker-plugin` can launch independent Maven builds from files such as
`src/it/*/pom.xml`. Those nested builds have their own dependency mediation and
can fail even when the parent module's normal unit tests pass.

If Maven reports output similar to:

```text
The following builds failed:
*  functional/pom.xml
```

then:

1. Locate the exact integration-test POM named by the Invoker.
2. Read the corresponding Invoker `build.log` or the surrounding CI output.
3. Identify the *first concrete compiler/test error* inside that nested build.
4. Inspect the nested POM's direct dependencies and versions.
6. Repair the nested dependency/configuration drift instead of broad-editing
   unrelated top-level modules.

Do not assume versions declared in the parent module automatically govern an
Invoker integration-test POM. An integration-test POM copied or synchronized
separately can become stale.

## Missing library classes usually indicate dependency-version drift

For a compiler error such as:

```text
cannot find symbol: class MoreObjects
location: package com.google.common.base
```

first ask which Guava version the failing nested build actually selected.
`MoreObjects` is an API-version signal: a stale/transitively selected Guava can
make valid test source fail even though the main reactor uses a newer Guava.

For test libraries that are designed to be version-coupled (for example
`guava` and `guava-testlib`), prefer an explicit, synchronized dependency set.
Do not "fix" valid source by rewriting it to avoid the missing API unless the
source itself is demonstrated to be wrong.

## Repository-specific checkpoint: AutoValue functional integration test

In this Google Auto snapshot, the historical CI failure is inside the Maven
Invoker build rooted at:

```text
value/src/it/functional/pom.xml
```

Synchronize this functional-test POM as one coherent dependency repair:

- `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305` -> `3.0.0` (`provided`);
- `junit:junit` -> `4.12` (`test`);
- add a direct `com.google.guava:guava:19.0` test dependency;
- `com.google.guava:guava-testlib` -> `19.0` (`test`);
- `com.google.truth:truth` -> `0.28` (`test`).

## Build-repair artifact contract

This benchmark requires both a diagnosis artifact and an applicable patch.
Before finishing:

1. Write `/home/travis/build/failed/failed_reasons.txt` with the reproduced
   target environment, the exact failing nested POM, the first real error, and
   the dependency-drift root cause.
2. Create at least one non-empty standard unified diff at
   `/home/travis/build/failed/google/auto/patch_1.diff` (or the repository path
   given by the task) containing the intended source/configuration change.
3. Apply that patch to the failed repository.
4. Check `git diff`/`git status` and ensure the intended project file—not only
   the patch artifact—was changed.
## Minimal diagnostic sequence

```bash
cd /home/travis/build/failed/google/auto

# 3. If AutoValue's Invoker functional build fails, inspect the nested POM.
sed -n '1,180p' value/src/it/functional/pom.xml
find value/target/it -name build.log -print

```

## General Maven lifecycle reminders

- In multi-module projects, use the reactor summary to identify the first
  genuinely failing module, then inspect that module's own integration steps.
