description: An overview of the core data API of ObsPy, a Python framework for processing seismological data. It is useful for parsing common seismological file formats, or manipulating custom data into standard objects for downstream use cases such as ObsPy's signal processing routines or SeisBench's modeling API.

# ObsPy Data API

## Waveform Data

### Summary

Seismograms of various formats (e.g. SAC, MiniSEED, GSE2, SEISAN, Q, etc.) can be imported into a `Stream` object using the `read()` function.

Streams are list-like objects which contain multiple `Trace` objects, i.e. gap-less continuous time series and related header/meta information.

Each Trace object has the attribute `data` pointing to a NumPy `ndarray` of the actual time series and the attribute `stats` which contains all meta information in a dict-like `Stats` object. Both attributes `starttime` and `endtime` of the Stats object are `UTCDateTime` objects.

A multitude of helper methods are attached to `Stream` and `Trace` objects for handling and modifying the waveform data.

### Stream and Trace Class Structure

**Hierarchy:** `Stream` → `Trace` (multiple)

**Trace - DATA:**
- `data` → NumPy array
- `stats`:
  - `network`, `station`, `location`, `channel` — Determine physical location and instrument
  - `starttime`, `sampling_rate`, `delta`, `endtime`, `npts` — Interrelated

**Trace - METHODS:**
- `taper()` — Tapers the data.
- `filter()` — Filters the data.
- `resample()` — Resamples the data in the frequency domain.
- `integrate()` — Integrates the data with respect to time.
- `remove_response()` — Deconvolves the instrument response.

### Column-to-channel mapping contract for custom arrays

When converting a custom two-dimensional array into ObsPy traces, validate the relationship between array columns and channel metadata before constructing the `Stream`:

1. Record `n_columns`, parse the supplied channel labels, and compare the two counts. Direct positional mapping is valid only when the metadata defines one reliable label for every data column.
2. If the counts differ, do not write `for i, label in enumerate(labels): Trace(data[:, i])`. That pattern silently truncates unlabelled columns and can turn a non-empty recording into an all-zero Stream.
3. Audit every data column independently for finite-value coverage, non-zero occupancy, and an energy statistic such as RMS. Preserve every signal-bearing column while resolving the mapping from an explicit schema, component suffixes, or other source metadata.
4. A single component label attached to a multi-column storage array does not prove that the label belongs to column 0. For example, if the only label denotes a vertical component and only one slot contains signal, map the label to the demonstrably signal-bearing slot rather than discarding it by position.
5. If multiple columns contain signal but the available metadata cannot establish their component order, record the ambiguity and seek an auditable schema or model-supported missing-component policy. Do not fabricate orientations, silently drop active columns, or claim a confident three-component mapping.
6. Before downstream processing, print or assert the final `source column -> Trace channel` mapping and verify that each constructed Trace has the expected sample count and non-zero/finite statistics.

### Example

A `Stream` with an example seismogram can be created by calling `read()` without any arguments. Local files can be read by specifying the filename, files stored on http servers (e.g. at https://examples.obspy.org) can be read by specifying their URL.

```python
>>> from obspy import read
>>> st = read()
>>> print(st)
3 Trace(s) in Stream:
BW.RJOB..EHZ | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
BW.RJOB..EHN | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
BW.RJOB..EHE | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
>>> tr = st[0]
>>> print(tr)
BW.RJOB..EHZ | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
>>> tr.data
array([ 0.        ,  0.00694644,  0.07597424, ...,  1.93449584,
        0.98196204,  0.44196924])
>>> print(tr.stats)
         network: BW
         station: RJOB
        location:
         channel: EHZ
       starttime: 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z
         endtime: 2009-08-24T00:20:32.990000Z
   sampling_rate: 100.0
           delta: 0.01
            npts: 3000
           calib: 1.0
           ...
>>> tr.stats.starttime
UTCDateTime(2009, 8, 24, 0, 20, 3)
```

## Event Metadata

Event metadata are handled in a hierarchy of classes closely modelled after the de-facto standard format [QuakeML](https://quake.ethz.ch/quakeml/). See `read_events()` and `Catalog.write()` for supported formats.

### Event Class Structure

**Hierarchy:** `Catalog` → `events` → `Event` (multiple)

**Event contains:**
- `origins` → `Origin` (multiple)
  - `latitude`, `longitude`, `depth`, `time`, ...
- `magnitudes` → `Magnitude` (multiple)
  - `mag`, `magnitude_type`, ...
- `picks`
- `focal_mechanisms`

## Station Metadata

Station metadata are handled in a hierarchy of classes closely modelled after the de-facto standard format [FDSN StationXML](https://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/) which was developed as a human readable XML replacement for Dataless SEED. See `read_inventory()` and `Inventory.write()` for supported formats.

### Inventory Class Structure

**Hierarchy:** `Inventory` → `networks` → `Network` → `stations` → `Station` → `channels` → `Channel`

**Network:**
- `code`, `description`, ...

**Station:**
- `code`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation`, `start_date`, `end_date`, ...

**Channel:**
- `code`, `location_code`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `elevation`, `depth`, `dip`, `azimuth`, `sample_rate`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `response`, ...
