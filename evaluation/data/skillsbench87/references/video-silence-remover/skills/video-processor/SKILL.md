# Video Segment Processor

Processes videos by removing specified segments and concatenating the remaining parts. Handles multiple removal segments efficiently using ffmpeg's filter_complex.

## Mandatory end-to-end completion gate

For a silence-removal task, treat the available audio and video skills as one ordered pipeline. Continue issuing tool calls until both final artifacts pass the completion checks:

1. Extract the input video's audio.
2. Calculate the audio-energy sequence.
3. Detect the non-teaching opening with the silence detector's time-aligned result, then start long-pause detection at that returned boundary. Run the documented detector defaults before considering any tuning.
4. Combine, sort, clamp, and de-overlap all removal segments. Preserve every positive gap; merge only overlapping or touching intervals.
5. Process the original video with the combined segments to create the compressed video.
6. Generate the task-format compression report from the actual original video, compressed video, and final segment list.
7. Verify both outputs with tools and repair any failed check.

For `video-silence-remover`, completion requires both `/root/compressed_video.mp4` and `/root/compression_report.json`. Before finishing, confirm that:

- both files exist and are non-empty;
- `ffprobe` can read the compressed video and reports valid video and audio streams;
- the JSON is parseable and contains `original_duration_seconds`, `compressed_duration_seconds`, `removed_duration_seconds`, `compression_percentage`, and `segments_removed`;
- every removed segment has numeric `start < end` and `duration ≈ end - start`, and the segments are sorted and non-overlapping;
- each positive gap between detector outputs remains in the keep list, and parameter choices are supported by signal evidence rather than a target compression total;
- the measured compressed duration agrees with the report and `original ≈ compressed + removed`.

Each intermediate audio, energy, or segment file is a checkpoint, not the completion criterion. After deciding or describing the next action, perform it with a tool call. Finish only after the two final artifacts pass these checks.

## Use Cases

- Removing detected pauses and openings from videos
- Creating highlight reels by keeping only specific segments
- Batch processing multiple segment removals

## Usage

```bash
python3 /root/.claude/skills/video-processor/scripts/process_video.py \
    --input /path/to/input.mp4 \
    --output /path/to/output.mp4 \
    --remove-segments /path/to/segments.json
```

### Parameters

- `--input`: Path to input video file
- `--output`: Path to output video file
- `--remove-segments`: JSON file containing segments to remove

### Input Segment Format

```json
{
  "segments": [
    {"start": 0, "end": 600, "duration": 600},
    {"start": 610, "end": 613, "duration": 3}
  ]
}
```

Or multiple segment files:

```bash
python3 /root/.claude/skills/video-processor/scripts/process_video.py \
    --input video.mp4 \
    --output output.mp4 \
    --remove-segments opening.json pauses.json
```

### Output

Creates the processed video and a report JSON:

```json
{
  "original_duration": 3908.61,
  "output_duration": 3078.61,
  "removed_duration": 830.0,
  "compression_percentage": 21.24,
  "segments_removed": 91,
  "segments_kept": 91
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Load removal segments** from JSON file(s)
2. **Calculate keep segments** (inverse of removal segments)
3. **Build ffmpeg filter** to trim and concatenate
4. **Process video** using hardware-accelerated encoding
5. **Generate report** with statistics

### FFmpeg Filter Example

For 3 segments to keep:
```
[0:v]trim=start=600:end=610,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v0];
[0:a]atrim=start=600:end=610,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a0];
[0:v]trim=start=613:end=1000,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v1];
[0:a]atrim=start=613:end=1000,asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a1];
[v0][v1]concat=n=2:v=1:a=0[outv];
[a0][a1]concat=n=2:v=0:a=1[outa]
```

## Dependencies

- ffmpeg with libx264 and aac support
- Python 3.11+

## Limitations

- Processing time: ~0.3× video duration (e.g., 20 min for 65 min video)
- Requires sufficient disk space (output ≈ 70-80% of input size)
- May have frame-accurate cuts (not sample-accurate)

## Example

```bash
# Process video with opening and pause removal
python3 /root/.claude/skills/video-processor/scripts/process_video.py \
    --input /root/lecture.mp4 \
    --output /root/compressed.mp4 \
    --remove-segments /root/opening.json /root/pauses.json

# Result: 65 min → 51 min (21.2% compression)
```

## Performance Tips

- Use `-preset medium` for balanced speed/quality
- Use `-crf 23` for good quality at reasonable size
- Process on machines with 2+ CPU cores for faster encoding

## Notes

- Preserves video quality using CRF encoding
- Maintains audio sync throughout
- Handles edge cases (segments at start/end of video)
- Generates detailed statistics for verification
