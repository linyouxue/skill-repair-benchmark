# SCIP Optimization

Use SCIP through `pyscipopt` when a task asks you to minimize or maximize an objective subject to constraints.

SCIP is a strong open-source optimization solver with a Python API. It is well suited for mixed-integer optimization, routing-style models, assignment models, capacity planning, inventory movement, scheduling, and problems with soft penalties. For benchmark tasks, a SCIP-backed model plus an independent validator is usually safer than a greedy construction.

## When To Use

Consider PySCIPOpt when the request includes:

- an objective such as minimizing cost, distance, time, unmet demand, or penalty;
- yes/no choices, route arcs, assignments, selected items, or ordering decisions;
- integer or continuous quantities such as load, inventory, flow, served units, or slack;
- hard rules that every valid answer must satisfy;
- soft rules that can be violated with an explicit penalty.

Do not start by installing another optimization package. First check whether PySCIPOpt is already available:

```python
try:
    from pyscipopt import Model, quicksum
except ImportError as exc:
    raise RuntimeError("PySCIPOpt is required for this optimization approach") from exc
```

## Modeling Workflow

1. Identify sets and indices.
   - Examples: vehicles `K`, stations `N`, jobs `J`, periods `T`, arcs `A`.
   - Build explicit mappings when input IDs are not contiguous.

2. Define decision variables.
   - Binary variables for choices, visits, assignments, route arcs, or modes.
   - Integer variables for counts, loads, inventory moves, or unmet units.
   - Continuous variables for flows, costs, times, slacks, or resource levels.

3. Add hard constraints.
   - Conservation, capacity, bounds, linking, continuity, inventory limits, and mutual exclusion.

4. Add soft constraints with explicit slack variables.
   - Never use Python `abs()` on solver expressions.
   - Linearize absolute deviation with two inequalities.

5. Set a single objective.
   - Keep named objective components such as travel cost and penalty cost.

6. Solve with time and gap limits, then apply the incumbent-quality gate below.
   - Require at least one incumbent to establish feasibility.
   - Do not extract a final answer until the task's objective-quality criterion is met.

7. Reconstruct and independently validate the output.
   - Recompute objective components and every hard rule from the reported answer.

## Minimal PySCIPOpt Template

```python
from pyscipopt import Model, quicksum

model = Model("optimization_model")
model.hideOutput()

I = range(n_items)

x = {i: model.addVar(vtype="B", name=f"x_{i}") for i in I}
amount = {
    i: model.addVar(vtype="I", lb=0, ub=capacity[i], name=f"amount_{i}")
    for i in I
}
dev = {i: model.addVar(lb=0, name=f"dev_{i}") for i in I}

for i in I:
    model.addCons(amount[i] <= capacity[i] * x[i])
    model.addCons(amount[i] - target[i] <= dev[i])
    model.addCons(target[i] - amount[i] <= dev[i])

cost = quicksum(fixed_cost[i] * x[i] for i in I)
penalty = penalty_weight * quicksum(dev[i] for i in I)
model.setObjective(cost + penalty, "minimize")

model.setParam("limits/time", 300.0)
target_gap = 0.01
model.setParam("limits/gap", target_gap)
model.optimize()

status = str(model.getStatus()).lower()
if model.getNSols() == 0:
    raise RuntimeError(f"SCIP found no feasible solution; status={status}")

objective = float(model.getObjVal())
dual_bound = float(model.getDualbound())
gap = float(model.getGap())
quality_ok = status == "optimal" or gap <= target_gap + 1e-12
if not quality_ok:
    raise RuntimeError(
        "SCIP has a feasible but provisional incumbent; improve it before export: "
        f"status={status}, objective={objective}, dual_bound={dual_bound}, "
        f"gap={gap}, target_gap={target_gap}"
    )

selected = [i for i in I if model.getVal(x[i]) > 0.5]
```

## Common Patterns

### Binary Activation

Use a binary variable to allow a quantity only when an option is active.

```python
use = {i: model.addVar(vtype="B", name=f"use_{i}") for i in I}
q = {i: model.addVar(lb=0, ub=upper[i], name=f"q_{i}") for i in I}

for i in I:
    model.addCons(q[i] <= upper[i] * use[i])
```

### Assignment

```python
assign = {
    (i, j): model.addVar(vtype="B", name=f"assign_{i}_{j}")
    for i in items
    for j in options
}

for i in items:
    model.addCons(quicksum(assign[i, j] for j in options) == 1)

for j in options:
    model.addCons(quicksum(weight[i] * assign[i, j] for i in items) <= capacity[j])
```

### Absolute Deviation Penalty

```python
dev = {i: model.addVar(lb=0, name=f"dev_{i}") for i in I}

for i in I:
    model.addCons(actual[i] - target[i] <= dev[i])
    model.addCons(target[i] - actual[i] <= dev[i])

penalty_cost = penalty_weight * quicksum(dev[i] for i in I)
```

### Route Arcs

```python
START = "depot_start"
END = "depot_end"
nodes_from = [START, *locations]
nodes_to = [*locations, END]
arcs = [
    (i, j)
    for i in nodes_from
    for j in nodes_to
    if i != j and not (i == START and j == END)
]

x = {
    (k, i, j): model.addVar(vtype="B", name=f"x_{k}_{i}_{j}")
    for k in vehicles
    for i, j in arcs
}

for k in vehicles:
    model.addCons(quicksum(x[k, START, j] for j in locations) == 1)
    model.addCons(quicksum(x[k, i, END] for i in locations) == 1)

    for i in locations:
        incoming = quicksum(x[k, j, i] for j in nodes_from if (j, i) in arcs)
        outgoing = quicksum(x[k, i, j] for j in nodes_to if (i, j) in arcs)
        model.addCons(incoming == outgoing)
        model.addCons(outgoing <= 1)
```

Degree and continuity constraints alone can permit disconnected cycles. Add subtour elimination for routing models.

### MTZ Subtour Elimination

```python
order = {
    (k, i): model.addVar(lb=1, ub=max(1, len(locations)), name=f"order_{k}_{i}")
    for k in vehicles
    for i in locations
}

n = len(locations)
for k in vehicles:
    for i in locations:
        for j in locations:
            if i != j:
                model.addCons(order[k, i] - order[k, j] + n * x[k, i, j] <= n - 1)
```

## Reproducibility

Fix SCIP randomization and thread settings when repeatability matters.

```python
def set_if_available(model, name, value):
    try:
        model.setParam(name, value)
    except Exception:
        pass

for name in [
    "randomization/randomseedshift",
    "randomization/permutationseed",
    "randomization/lpseed",
]:
    set_if_available(model, name, 0)

for name in ["randomization/permutevars", "randomization/permuteconss"]:
    set_if_available(model, name, False)

set_if_available(model, "parallel/maxnthreads", 1)
```

## Incumbent Quality Gate

When the task scores objective quality, a feasible incumbent is not automatically a publishable answer. `model.getNSols() > 0` establishes only that SCIP found a feasible solution. A configured `limits/gap` is a stopping target, not evidence that the achieved gap is acceptable.

Before solving, derive and predeclare a checkable quality criterion from the public task contract: proven optimality, an explicit objective threshold, or a stated relative or absolute gap. Do not relax this gate after seeing the incumbent. If the task provides no tolerance, use a conservative small gap and the documented solve budget rather than accepting the first feasible incumbent.

After every solve, record and inspect the status, incumbent objective, dual bound, and achieved relative gap, as shown in the template above.

Treat the quality gate as failed when SCIP stops at a time or resource limit and the achieved gap or objective still misses the task criterion. In that case, keep the incumbent and continue with a task-justified larger time budget, a warm start, or a stronger formulation or cut strategy. Do not replace a documented reference budget with a substantially shorter limit merely to finish sooner when objective quality is scored.

Only serialize the final answer after the quality gate passes. The run log should retain the solver status, incumbent objective, dual bound, achieved gap, and acceptance criterion so that solution quality can be audited separately from feasibility and report arithmetic.

## Extraction And Validation

After solving, reconstruct the answer from variable values and validate it outside SCIP.

```python
def is_selected(var):
    return model.getVal(var) > 0.5

selected_arcs = [(i, j) for i, j in arcs if is_selected(x[vehicle, i, j])]
reported_cost = sum(distance[i, j] for i, j in selected_arcs)

if abs(reported_cost - expected_cost) > 1e-6:
    raise AssertionError("reported objective component does not match reconstruction")
```

Treat SCIP feasibility as necessary but not sufficient. The final reported file still needs both the solver-quality certificate above and independent checks for schema, route reconstruction, capacity, inventory, penalties, and objective arithmetic.
