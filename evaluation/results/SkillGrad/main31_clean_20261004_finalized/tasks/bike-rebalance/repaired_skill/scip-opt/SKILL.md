# SCIP Optimization

Use SCIP through `pyscipopt` when a task asks you to minimize or maximize an objective subject to constraints.

SCIP is a strong open-source optimization solver with a Python API. It is well suited for mixed-integer optimization, routing-style models, assignment models, capacity planning, inventory movement, scheduling, and problems with soft penalties. For benchmark tasks, a SCIP-backed model plus an independent validator is usually safer than a greedy construction.

## Execution Workflow (don’t stop early)

1. Locate and read the input in a way your environment permits (tool sandbox vs terminal).
2. Parse input → build sets/mappings → decide modeling approach.
3. Build the model (variables, hard constraints, soft penalties, objective).
4. Solve, then extract a concrete solution (routes/assignments/amounts) from variable values.
5. **Write the required deliverable file(s)** to the expected path(s).
6. **Re-open what you wrote and validate completeness** (schema keys present, expected counts/IDs covered, and basic invariants). If any check fails, continue working and re-validate.

Read references/deliverable-artifact-check.md when the task is graded on a required JSON/CSV artifact (e.g., `report.json`) or when a prior attempt ended without writing outputs. Skip when the evaluator reads only stdout and no output file is required.

## When To Use

Consider PySCIPOpt when the request includes:

- an objective such as minimizing cost, distance, time, unmet demand, or penalty;
- yes/no choices, route arcs, assignments, selected items, or ordering decisions;
- integer or continuous quantities such as load, inventory, flow, served units, or slack;
- hard rules that every valid answer must satisfy;
- soft rules that can be violated with an explicit penalty.

Do not start by installing another optimization package. First check whether PySCIPOpt is already available:

```python
try:
    from pyscipopt import Model, quicksum
except ImportError as exc:
    raise RuntimeError("PySCIPOpt is required for this optimization approach") from exc
```

## Modeling Workflow

1. Identify sets and indices.
   - Examples: vehicles `K`, stations `N`, jobs `J`, periods `T`, arcs `A`.
   - Build explicit mappings when input IDs are not contiguous.

2. Define decision variables.
   - Binary variables for choices, visits, assignments, route arcs, or modes.
   - Integer variables for counts, loads, inventory moves, or unmet units.
   - Continuous variables for flows, costs, times, slacks, or resource levels.

3. Add hard constraints.
   - Conservation, capacity, bounds, linking, continuity, inventory limits, and mutual exclusion.

4. Add soft constraints with explicit slack variables.
   - Never use Python `abs()` on solver expressions.
   - Linearize absolute deviation with two inequalities.

5. Set a single objective.
   - Keep named objective components such as travel cost and penalty cost.

6. Solve with time and gap limits.
   - Require at least one incumbent before extracting a solution.

7. **Optimality gate (benchmark objective alignment).**
   - If the task is graded on objective quality, treat “feasible + self-consistent” as insufficient.
   - Before finalizing, inspect solver status, best bound, and the implied optimality gap; if not optimal/tight enough, re-solve with more time or a tighter formulation.
   - **Also sanity-check semantics that change the feasible set.** In particular, decide whether the system is closed (unit conservation) and how initial/end loads are anchored.
     - Closed system (no source/sink): enforce system-wide conservation and fix starting loads to the stated value (often 0), with end loads consistent with conservation.
     - Depot is a source/sink: constrain depot inventory/supply and link any nonzero start loads or depot transfers to that supply.
   - Post-solve quality probe: if any unmet/deviation remains, test whether it can be reduced with a small objective increase (e.g., lexicographic “minimize unmet then distance”, or temporarily raise penalty weights). If it can, treat that as evidence of semantics mismatch or insufficient optimality/tightness.

```python
model.optimize()

status = str(model.getStatus()).lower()
if model.getNSols() == 0:
    raise RuntimeError(f"SCIP found no feasible solution; status={status}")

obj = float(model.getObjVal())
try:
    bound = float(model.getBestbound())
except Exception:
    bound = None

if "optimal" not in status and bound is not None and obj != 0.0:
    gap = abs(obj - bound) / abs(obj)
    if gap > 1e-4:
        raise RuntimeError(f"solution not tight enough: status={status} obj={obj} bound={bound} gap={gap}")
```

Read references/scip-optimality-gate.md when the benchmark expects (near-)optimal objective value, you used a time limit/nonzero gap, or resource/conservation semantics (optional vehicles, depot source/sink, start loads) are ambiguous. Skip when feasibility alone is graded or when the evaluator explicitly accepts any feasible solution.

## Minimal PySCIPOpt Template

```python
from pyscipopt import Model, quicksum

model = Model("optimization_model")
model.hideOutput()

I = range(n_items)

x = {i: model.addVar(vtype="B", name=f"x_{i}") for i in I}
amount = {
    i: model.addVar(vtype="I", lb=0, ub=capacity[i], name=f"amount_{i}")
    for i in I
}
dev = {i: model.addVar(lb=0, name=f"dev_{i}") for i in I}

for i in I:
    model.addCons(amount[i] <= capacity[i] * x[i])
    model.addCons(amount[i] - target[i] <= dev[i])
    model.addCons(target[i] - amount[i] <= dev[i])

cost = quicksum(fixed_cost[i] * x[i] for i in I)
penalty = penalty_weight * quicksum(dev[i] for i in I)
model.setObjective(cost + penalty, "minimize")

model.setParam("limits/time", 300.0)
model.setParam("limits/gap", 0.01)
model.optimize()

status = str(model.getStatus()).lower()
if model.getNSols() == 0:
    raise RuntimeError(f"SCIP found no feasible solution; status={status}")

objective = float(model.getObjVal())
selected = [i for i in I if model.getVal(x[i]) > 0.5]
```

## Common Patterns

### Binary Activation

Use a binary variable to allow a quantity only when an option is active.

```python
use = {i: model.addVar(vtype="B", name=f"use_{i}") for i in I}
q = {i: model.addVar(lb=0, ub=upper[i], name=f"q_{i}") for i in I}

for i in I:
    model.addCons(q[i] <= upper[i] * use[i])
```

### Assignment

```python
assign = {
    (i, j): model.addVar(vtype="B", name=f"assign_{i}_{j}")
    for i in items
    for j in options
}

for i in items:
    model.addCons(quicksum(assign[i, j] for j in options) == 1)

for j in options:
    model.addCons(quicksum(weight[i] * assign[i, j] for i in items) <= capacity[j])
```

### Absolute Deviation Penalty

```python
dev = {i: model.addVar(lb=0, name=f"dev_{i}") for i in I}

for i in I:
    model.addCons(actual[i] - target[i] <= dev[i])
    model.addCons(target[i] - actual[i] <= dev[i])

penalty_cost = penalty_weight * quicksum(dev[i] for i in I)
```

### Route Arcs

```python
START = "depot_start"
END = "depot_end"
nodes_from = [START, *locations]
nodes_to = [*locations, END]
arcs = [
    (i, j)
    for i in nodes_from
    for j in nodes_to
    if i != j and not (i == START and j == END)
]

x = {
    (k, i, j): model.addVar(vtype="B", name=f"x_{k}_{i}_{j}")
    for k in vehicles
    for i, j in arcs
}

for k in vehicles:
    model.addCons(quicksum(x[k, START, j] for j in locations) == 1)
    model.addCons(quicksum(x[k, i, END] for i in locations) == 1)

    for i in locations:
        incoming = quicksum(x[k, j, i] for j in nodes_from if (j, i) in arcs)
        outgoing = quicksum(x[k, i, j] for j in nodes_to if (i, j) in arcs)
        model.addCons(incoming == outgoing)
        model.addCons(outgoing <= 1)
```

Degree and continuity constraints alone can permit disconnected cycles. Add subtour elimination for routing models.

### MTZ Subtour Elimination

```python
order = {
    (k, i): model.addVar(lb=1, ub=max(1, len(locations)), name=f"order_{k}_{i}")
    for k in vehicles
    for i in locations
}

n = len(locations)
for k in vehicles:
    for i in locations:
        for j in locations:
            if i != j:
                model.addCons(order[k, i] - order[k, j] + n * x[k, i, j] <= n - 1)
```

## Reproducibility

Fix SCIP randomization and thread settings when repeatability matters.

```python
def set_if_available(model, name, value):
    try:
        model.setParam(name, value)
    except Exception:
        pass

for name in [
    "randomization/randomseedshift",
    "randomization/permutationseed",
    "randomization/lpseed",
]:
    set_if_available(model, name, 0)

for name in ["randomization/permutevars", "randomization/permuteconss"]:
    set_if_available(model, name, False)

set_if_available(model, "parallel/maxnthreads", 1)
```

## Extraction And Validation

After solving, reconstruct the answer from variable values and validate it outside SCIP.

```python
def is_selected(var):
    return model.getVal(var) > 0.5

selected_arcs = [(i, j) for i, j in arcs if is_selected(x[vehicle, i, j])]
reported_cost = sum(distance[i, j] for i, j in selected_arcs)

if abs(reported_cost - expected_cost) > 1e-6:
    raise AssertionError("reported objective component does not match reconstruction")
```

Treat SCIP feasibility as necessary but not sufficient. The final reported file still needs independent checks for schema, route reconstruction, capacity, inventory, penalties, and objective arithmetic.

## Common Pitfalls

- Accepting a time-limited incumbent without checking `getStatus()`, best bound, and the implied optimality gap when the evaluator expects an optimal (or near-optimal) objective.
- Missing or ambiguous semantics that change the feasible set (e.g., optional vs required resources, or unanchored initial/end loads in a conservation model).
- Using loose Big‑M bounds, which can slow SCIP and lead to weak incumbents.
