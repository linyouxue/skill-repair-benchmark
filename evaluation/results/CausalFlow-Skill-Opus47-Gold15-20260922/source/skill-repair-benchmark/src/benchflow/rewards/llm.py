    ``env`` carries the resolved ``[verifier.judge]`` credentials (API keys

    being written into the process-global ``os.environ`` — concurrent judge
    runs (``asyncio.gather`` with concurrency > 1) would otherwise race on
    the shared environment and see each other's credentials. ``env`` keys
    are layered over (and take precedence on a per-call basis without
    mutating) the ambient process environment.

    Tries Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google SDKs in order based on the
    model string.

    When the model name carries a *known* provider prefix (``claude-``,
    ``gpt-``, ``gemini``, ...), only that provider can serve it: a real
    API failure (bad key, model not found, retries exhausted) is raised
    as-is rather than being masked by a different provider rejecting the
    same model name.

    When the prefix is *unknown* (``mistral-large``, ``deepseek-chat``, a
    custom name), the provider cannot be determined up front, so every
    provider is tried in turn. A real API failure from one provider then
    falls through to the next instead of aborting the whole call.

    A missing SDK (``ImportError``) falls through to the next provider —
    *except* when the model name confidently matches a single provider whose
    SDK is absent. In that case there is no other provider that can serve the
    model, so a clear ``JudgeEnvironmentError`` naming the provider and the
