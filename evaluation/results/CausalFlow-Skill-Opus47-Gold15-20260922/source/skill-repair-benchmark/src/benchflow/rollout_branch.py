"""The Branch -> Rollout engine wiring.

The pure Branch primitives live in :mod:`benchflow.branch` — ``checkpoint``,
``restore``, ``aggregate`` operate on a ``RolloutTree`` node and an
``Environment`` with no I/O beyond the env contract. This module is the
*engine*: it drives those primitives against a live
:class:`~benchflow.rollout.Rollout` — quiescing the agent, running each forked
child as an **isolated sub-rollout**, and restoring the parent's linear state
afterward.

Why a separate module: ``rollout.py`` is the 5-phase lifecycle; the Branch
path is a distinct, optional capability. Keeping it here holds ``rollout.py``
under the size threshold and keeps the branch logic independently testable.

The engine functions are free functions taking a ``Rollout`` as their first
argument — ``Rollout.branch`` is a thin one-line entry point that delegates
here.

Isolation invariant (the architecture's "tree is additive / no-regression"):
after :func:`branch` returns, the parent Rollout's linear state — ``_cursor``,
``_trajectory``, ``_rewards``, ``_phase``, ``_n_tool_calls`` (and the session
bookkeeping) — is *exactly* what it was before. A branch child never
re-entrantly mutates the shared instance: it runs against a scoped snapshot of
that state, captured before and restored after each child, and its real
continuation Steps attach to a *pending* branch-child node so the reward and
value land on the right node.
