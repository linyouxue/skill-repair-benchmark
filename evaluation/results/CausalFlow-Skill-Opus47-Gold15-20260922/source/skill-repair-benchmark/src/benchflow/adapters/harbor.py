"""Inbound adapter for the Harbor task format.

Harbor (``harbor-framework/harbor``) is the upstream task framework
BenchFlow's own :class:`~benchflow.task.config.TaskConfig` was internalized
from. A Harbor task directory is therefore *already* in
BenchFlow-native shape:

::

    task_dir/
    ├── task.toml          # [task] [metadata] [verifier] [agent] [environment]
    ├── instruction.md
    ├── environment/       # Dockerfile + build context
    ├── solution/          # solve.sh — the oracle
    └── tests/             # test.sh — the verifier

This adapter is consequently a thin *normalizer*: it loads the foreign
``task.toml`` through the native :class:`TaskConfig` validator (which already
handles Harbor's ``[environment]``-keyed sandbox section and the
``version`` -> ``schema_version`` rename), reads ``instruction.md``, and
records the build/solution/test files under their native relative paths. No
field remapping is needed — Harbor *is* the native format, which is exactly
what makes Terminal-Bench backward-compatible through this edge.
