"""Inbound environment adapters — the shared edge contract.

An *inbound* adapter translates a foreign benchmark's task directory into
BenchFlow's native **Environment-plane** representation (architecture.md,
"The edges — adapters & trainers", and "The Environment plane & the
manifest"). The native seam is the :class:`EnvironmentManifest`; the
legacy ``task.toml`` + ``environment/`` / ``tests/`` / ``solution/``
subtree layout is preserved on :class:`InboundTask` as a downstream
compatibility layer so existing materialization paths keep working.

This module defines the pieces every inbound adapter shares:

* :class:`InboundTask` — the translation *result* and the real contract: a
  benchmark-agnostic, in-memory view of one task carrying a validated
  :class:`~benchflow.environment.manifest.EnvironmentManifest` (the
  Environment-plane seam), the instruction text, a validated
  :class:`~benchflow.task.config.TaskConfig` (legacy task-file
  compatibility), and a file map keyed by BenchFlow-native relative
  paths. Every inbound adapter is just a
  ``from_task_dir(Path) -> InboundTask`` classmethod.
* :func:`manifest_from_task_config` — derive a baseline
  :class:`EnvironmentManifest` from a foreign task's
  :class:`TaskConfig`. Adapters that find a sibling ``environment.toml``
  load it directly; adapters with no manifest file fall through to this
  helper so the Environment-plane seam is always populated.
* :func:`detect_adapter` — sniffs a task directory and returns the adapter
  whose foreign format it matches.

Adapters are *pure translators*: they read a directory and return data. They
do not build sandboxes, run verifiers, or touch the rollout runtime. The
``files`` map carries source paths under their BenchFlow-native destination
so a caller can materialize a runnable task directory without the adapter
performing any I/O of its own beyond reading.

    * ``manifest.image`` is the task's prebuilt ``docker_image`` when set,
