"""The LearnerStore — the persistent, versioned store behind continual learning.

Continual learning (architecture.md § "The eight capabilities", row 5) is a
**Job run in ``sequential-shared`` mode**: Rollouts run in order over one
persistent **learner store** of memory + skills. It is a Job *mode*, not a new
top-level object.

The store has three defining properties:

* **Persistent** — it lives across the whole Job; every rollout reads the
  current state and may write an evolved one back.
* **Versioned** — every write stamps a monotonic *generation* counter, so a
  rollout's contribution is addressable after the fact.
* **Rollback-capable** — :meth:`LearnerStore.commit_or_revert` rejects a
  regression when a learning-curve metric drops, keeping the store at the
  better generation.

The learner store is deliberately the *one* snapshot layer that does **not**
roll back with a ``Branch`` (architecture.md § "Lifecycles"): a Branch rolls
back the world (container / environment-state / agent-session) to estimate
``V(s)``; the learner store is the agent's accumulating memory and must survive
those forks. Its rollback is a *separate*, generation-scoped operation driven by
the learning curve, not by the tree.

This module is pure data — no I/O, no sandbox, no live runs. The Job
orchestrator (``evaluation.py``) drives it; the store itself just holds and
versions state.
