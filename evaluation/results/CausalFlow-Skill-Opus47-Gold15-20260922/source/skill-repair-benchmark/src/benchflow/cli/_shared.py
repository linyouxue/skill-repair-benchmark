"""Shared console + display helpers for the benchflow CLI command modules.

These are the cross-cutting, side-effect-free helpers that several CLI command
groups (``cli/main.py`` and the ``cli/<group>.py`` modules) need in common: the
shared Rich :data:`console`, the evaluation-result summary/exit helpers, and the
agent ``Requires`` rendering used by ``agents``/``agent`` listings. The one
file-reading step of the eval report (mining verifier artifacts for failure
evidence) is delegated to :mod:`._failure_evidence` to keep that claim true.

Keeping them here lets each command group import one stable surface instead of
re-deriving the formatting, and lets ``cli/main.py`` stay a thin app + eval
wiring module while preserving identical output.
