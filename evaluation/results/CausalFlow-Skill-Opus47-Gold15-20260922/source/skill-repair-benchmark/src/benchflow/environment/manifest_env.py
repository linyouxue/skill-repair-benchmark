"""ManifestEnvironment — the default Environment-plane adapter.

Implements the ``Environment`` protocol from an ``EnvironmentManifest``,
running over any ``Sandbox`` provider. This is the "zero-modification
adoption" path: a benchmark writes a manifest, this class runs it.

**Topology — in-sandbox (the architecture's core).** The environment's
services run *inside the rollout's own sandbox*, sharing its network
namespace, so the agent reaches them on ``localhost``. This adapter starts
the manifest's ``[[services]]`` and health-checks them with ``sandbox.exec``
— it is the declarative replacement for the hard-coded ``SERVICES`` dict +
``build_service_hooks`` in ``benchflow.sandbox.services``.

One manifest serves a whole benchmark even when, as with smolclaws, each
task is a per-task image carrying only a subset of the services: ``provision``
probes ``command -v`` and starts only the services actually installed (the
same idea as ``detect_services_from_dockerfile``).

Environment-state ``snapshot``/``restore`` are real here — roll-back over the
SQLite files an ``[environment.state]`` table declares. ``reset`` returns the
environment to the per-task baseline by stopping the services the framework
started, restoring the baseline snapshot captured during ``provision`` (when
``[environment.state]`` is declared), and restarting the services. The sidecar
/ shared-fleet topology (host-exposed ports, ``wait_for_readiness`` over
httpx) remains the platform layer.
