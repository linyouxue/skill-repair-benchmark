"""EnvironmentManifest — the declarative integration surface of the
Environment plane.

A benchmark ships an ``environment.toml``; this module loads it into a
validated model. Writing this manifest is the entire framework-integration
surface for a stateful benchmark (architecture.md, "The Environment plane
& the manifest").

The schema is honest to the two real stateful-multi-service benchmarks:

* **ClawsBench / smolclaws** — a ``base_image`` plus per-task images that
  bake seed data; the image has no service-starting entrypoint, so the
  framework starts the mock services itself from the ``[[environment.services]]``
  array (this array replaces the hard-coded ``SERVICES`` dict in
  ``benchflow.sandbox.services``). Task selection is ``image``-based.
* **chi-bench** — a single ``image`` whose entrypoint starts the services
  (``owns_lifecycle = true``); the task is chosen at runtime via an env var.
