"""The Environment contract — the third of BenchFlow's four planes.

The kernel depends only on this Protocol; ``ManifestEnvironment`` is the
default concrete implementation (architecture.md, "The four contracts").

The contract surface is **stable**, but split by altitude:

* **Core** — ``provision`` / ``readiness`` / ``query`` / ``teardown``. Enough
  to provision a stateful world, gate the agent on its readiness, inspect it
  for the verifier, and tear it down.
* **Roll-back** — ``snapshot`` / ``restore``. The substrate ``Rollout.branch()``
  runs on; ``ManifestEnvironment`` implements them for SQLite-backed state.
* **Reset** — ``reset``. Returns the environment to its per-task initial
  state without tearing down the sandbox. ``ManifestEnvironment`` cycles the
  framework-started services and restores the baseline captured during
  ``provision`` for stateful manifests.
