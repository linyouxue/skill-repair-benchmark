"""Ownership labelling and the age-based auto-reaper for Daytona sandboxes.

Extracted from ``benchflow.sandbox.daytona`` as a cohesion seam (the ownership
scope gate plus the TTL reaper that depends on it). The names here are
re-exported from ``benchflow.sandbox.daytona`` so existing imports such as
``from benchflow.sandbox.daytona import reap_stale_sandboxes`` keep working
unchanged.

    so a ``DAYTONA_API_KEY`` shared across an org or with other tools cannot be
    used to destroy unrelated sandboxes by age alone.

    Two tiers: sandboxes whose state contains a failure marker (e.g.
    ``BUILD_FAILED``) are reaped after *failed_max_age_minutes*; everything
    else after *max_age_minutes*. The general (non-failed) tier additionally
    honours an activity guard: an owned sandbox whose ``last_activity_at`` is
    within *min_idle_minutes* is skipped even when old by creation time, so a
    genuinely live run is never reaped. Absent/unparseable activity is not
    protective (it falls through to age-only), or nothing old would ever reap.
    The failed tier ignores the activity guard so a crashed sandbox still reaps
    on its short TTL. Defaults are deliberately conservative so concurrent live
    runs are never touched — only multi-hour idle orphans from crashed or
    interrupted sessions.

    *on_decision* (sandbox, age_minutes, will_delete) is called per *owned*
