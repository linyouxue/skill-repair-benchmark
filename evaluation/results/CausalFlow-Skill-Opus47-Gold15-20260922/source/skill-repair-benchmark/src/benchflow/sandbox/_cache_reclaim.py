# Symlink- and workspace-safe cache reclaim for #601.
#
# The previous shell form (`rm -rf "$u/.cache/uv" ...; rm -rf /tmp/uv-*`) could
# delete agent-visible state before scoring: `rm -rf` traverses intermediate
# symlinks (an agent-planted `~/.cache -> /app` turned the cache delete into
# `rm -rf /app/uv`), and the `/tmp/uv-*` glob matched a legitimate
# `/tmp/uv-workspace`. The textual `$WS`/`$u` guard saw none of that. Since
# ``restore_workspace`` defaults to False, nothing undid the damage.
#
# This snippet hardens every deletion candidate:
#  - rejects any candidate with a symlink path component, including the final
#    one, so agent-controlled parents can no longer redirect the delete;
#  - resolves protected roots (workspace + /logs, covering /logs/artifacts and
#    /logs/verifier) via realpath and skips candidates overlapping in either
#    direction, applied uniformly to per-user caches, /tmp globs, and apt;
#  - deletes with shutil.rmtree, which removes child symlinks without following
#    them.
#
# argv[1] = active workspace (or /nonexistent). argv[2] = optional filesystem
# prefix, "" in production; tests pass a temp root so the exact production code
# runs hermetically against a fake filesystem.
#
# Fail-safe by construction: if python3 is unavailable the reclaim simply does
# not run (the trailing `true` swallows it). Losing best-effort ENOSPC mitigation
# is strictly better than deleting the wrong state.
