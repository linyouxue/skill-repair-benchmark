"""How a task image gets built and pushed to ECR for the AgentCore backend.

AgentCore only accepts an image that already exists in ECR, so something has
to build one. Two strategies:

* :class:`LocalDockerBuilder` shells out to the local Docker daemon. Fast when
  the host is arm64 (a native build), and the obvious choice on a developer
  machine.
* :class:`CodeBuildBuilder` ships the build context to S3 and builds it in AWS
  CodeBuild on a Graviton worker, pushing straight to ECR. Nothing is required
  locally — no Docker, no arm64 host, no qemu — which is what makes the
  backend usable from a laptop without a container runtime, from CI, and from
  Windows.

The default is ``auto``: use Docker when a working daemon is present, and fall
back to CodeBuild when it is not. Selection is explicit in the logs, because
"why did this build take four minutes" should never be a mystery.
