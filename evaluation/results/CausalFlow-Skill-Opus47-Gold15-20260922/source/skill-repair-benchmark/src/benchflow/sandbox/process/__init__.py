"""Live stdio connections to a process inside a sandbox.

Provides a bidirectional pipe (send lines in, read lines out) needed for
ACP agents running inside containers. Implementations:

- DockerProcess:         `docker compose exec -i` (local Docker)
- AppleContainerProcess: `container exec -i` (Apple Container)
- DaytonaProcess:        SSH to a Daytona sandbox
- DaytonaPtyProcess:     Daytona PTY WebSocket
- AgentCoreProcess:      Bedrock AgentCore shell WebSocket

The first three are local-subprocess transports and share
:class:`SubprocessLiveProcess`; the last two carry bytes over a WebSocket and
implement :class:`LiveProcess` directly.

This package was a single ``process.py`` until it outgrew 1000 lines. Import
paths are unchanged — everything public is re-exported here.
