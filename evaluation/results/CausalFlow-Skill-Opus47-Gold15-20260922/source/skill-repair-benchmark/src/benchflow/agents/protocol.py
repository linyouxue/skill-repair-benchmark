"""The Agent contract — the second of BenchFlow's four planes.

The kernel depends only on these Protocols (architecture.md, "The four
contracts"). The Agent plane answers *who acts*: the agent under test
(eval) or the policy under training.

Two Protocols, one per altitude of the plane:

* ``Agent`` — the *factory*. Declared once, it connects to a sandbox in a
  given role and hands back a live ``Session``.
* ``Session`` — the **real behavioural surface of the plane**: the live
  agent conversation. ``prompt`` carries the task instruction and every
  nudge; ``on_ask_user`` is the agent-initiated branch hook; ``steps`` is
  the session's contribution to the rollout trajectory.

The ACP classes (``ACPClient`` / ``ACPSession``) are the first concrete
implementation; ``ACPSessionAdapter`` below is the thin, documented
adapter that makes ``ACPClient`` honour the ``Session`` contract.

    The architecture's ``Session`` is one object with the live verbs

    * :class:`~benchflow.acp.client.ACPClient` — owns the live verbs

    * :class:`~benchflow.acp.session.ACPSession` — owns the accumulated
      state (tool calls, message chunks, events).

    This adapter is the thin, documented seam that re-unifies them into a
    single ``Session``. It is **not** an ACP rewrite — it delegates every
    call straight through. One residual gap with the architecture's shape,
    kept explicit here rather than papered over:

    * ``steps`` maps onto ``ACPSession.events`` — the chronological event
      log. The kernel's ``Step`` noun is not yet a typed object, so the
      adapter surfaces the raw event dicts.

    ``on_ask_user`` forwards to ``ACPClient.on_ask_user`` so the registered
    handler runs on the live ACP ``session/request_permission`` path; without
    that forwarding the handler was bypassed and the auto-approve policy ran
