"""Thin agent-manifest loader — the consumer half of the decoupling contract.

An agent declares itself in a ``manifest.toml`` (see the agents repo's
``contract/manifest_schema.json`` for the authoritative, strict schema). Core
*consumes* that declaration here, turning it into the ``AgentConfig`` the rest
of BenchFlow already understands — so a new agent can ship as data (a manifest)
instead of a hand-edited entry in ``registry.AGENTS`` (design decision #4), and
a directory of manifests can be merged into the registry at opt-in (#7).

Authoring vs. consuming, on purpose:

* The agents-repo JSON Schema is the *author's* contract — ``additionalProperties:
  false``, every field type-checked. It fails an author loudly for a typo.
* This loader is the *consumer's* contract — it enforces only the major-version
  gate and the four required keys, then maps the declared fields onto
  AgentConfig and **ignores unknown keys**. A v1.x manifest that carries a field
  added in a later minor still loads on this v1 loader (SemVer: a minor bump is a
  backward-compatible addition). The AgentConfig fields outside the contract are
  the shim/credential set (session_factory, credential_files, subscription_auth,
  acp_model_config_id, acp_effort_config_id, disallow_web_tools_*); they keep
  their AgentConfig defaults because they are logic the shim owns, not data
  (see _SHIM_ONLY and the partition test).
