"""Miss-driven auto-load of DECLARATIVE agent manifests from a remote source.

Design: #876 (Phase 2a). When ``--agent <name>`` does not resolve locally,
benchflow fetches the pinned agents source (default: the first-party
``benchflow-ai/agents`` repo, cloned+cached through the same
``benchmark_repos`` machinery task sources use) and registers every
``manifest.toml`` agent found there that does not collide with anything already
registered — then resolution is retried.

Why this is safe to do automatically, unlike installing agent packages: a
manifest is **pure data**. Its ``install_cmd``/``launch_cmd`` strings execute
inside the task sandbox — exactly the trust level of a task fetched with
``--source-repo`` (and of harbor's ``acp:<id>`` registry auto-fetch, which also
fetches data and executes it sandboxed). No remote code ever runs in the host
process. Host-side *python* agent adapters (e.g. omnigent's session-factory)
are deliberately NOT auto-loaded — those remain explicit installs.

Semantics:

* **Gap-fill only** — an agent name or alias that already exists locally
  always wins; the remote manifest for it is skipped (never overwritten).
* **One-shot per process** — the first resolution miss triggers at most one
  fetch; later misses fail fast as before.
* **Guarded** — a broken manifest (or an unreachable source) logs a warning
  and never breaks agent resolution.
* **Opt-out / re-point** — ``BENCHFLOW_AGENTS_SOURCE=off`` disables;
  ``BENCHFLOW_AGENTS_SOURCE=owner/repo[@ref]`` re-pins; a local directory path
  is also accepted (dev/tests).
