"""The continual-learning skill producer — the data path of capability 5.

Capability 5 (continual learning, ``architecture.md`` § "The eight
capabilities", row 5) has two halves that were built separately:

* the :class:`~benchflow.learner_store.LearnerStore` — a persistent,
  generation-versioned store of the agent's evolving (memory + skills) state;
* the Memory-space scorer (:class:`~benchflow.rewards.memory_scorer.MemoryScorer`)
  — which reads a ``memory_delta`` record off a tree node and scores whether
  the agent updated its skills correctly.

This module is the **producer** that connects them. Without it the store's
``skills`` are never populated by a rollout and the scorer's ``memory_delta``
is never written — two halves with no data path.

The mechanism deliberately *reuses* BenchFlow's existing skill machinery
(``RolloutConfig.skills_dir`` for injection, ``export_generated_skills_to`` for
capture — see ``rollout.py``), it does not reinvent it:

* :func:`materialize_skills` writes a :class:`LearnerState`'s skills out as a
  directory of ``<name>/SKILL.md`` packs — exactly the ``skills_dir`` layout
  the agent reads, so rollout N starts from the store's *evolved* skill set.
* :func:`capture_skills` reads an exported skills directory (the
  ``export_generated_skills_to`` target — again ``<name>/SKILL.md`` packs)
  back into a plain ``dict``, ready to be committed as the next
  :class:`LearnerState`.
* :func:`skill_memory_delta` builds the ``{before, after, expected}`` record
  the Memory scorer expects on ``node.state["memory_delta"]``.

Pure filesystem translation — no sandbox, no async, no live runs. The Job
orchestrator (``evaluation.py``) drives it.
