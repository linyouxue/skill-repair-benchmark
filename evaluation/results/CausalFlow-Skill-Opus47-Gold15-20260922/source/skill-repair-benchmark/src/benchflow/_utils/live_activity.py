"""Process-global registry of live rollouts for the eval dashboard.

The Rich dashboard (``cli/_live_progress.py``) renders in the same process as
the engine's rollouts, so surfacing per-task activity needs no new event
plumbing: the engine registers each live Rollout under its task name and the
dashboard polls the rollout's ACP session counters — the exact ones the
console heartbeat (``ACPSession._maybe_log_progress``) logs — at render time.
Best-effort by contract: every reader failure degrades to "no activity",
never to a render error.
