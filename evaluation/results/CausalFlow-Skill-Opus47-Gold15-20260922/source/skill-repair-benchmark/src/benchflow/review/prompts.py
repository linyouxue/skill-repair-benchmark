"""Prompt rendering for the rubric reviewer.

The reviewer instruction is assembled host-side from a template plus the
rubric's guidance lines and the structured-output schema, then baked into the
wrapper task's instruction body. Templates may omit supported placeholders,
but unknown or misspelled placeholders fail loudly before the reviewer runs.

Available placeholders:

- ``{trial_path}`` — absolute in-sandbox path of the read-only rollout evidence copy.
- ``{task_section}`` — pre-rendered paragraph describing the task-definition
  copy (or its absence).
- ``{criteria_guidance}`` — one ``- name: guidance`` line per criterion.
- ``{result_path}`` / ``{output_schema}`` — output-contract details.

Before judging, read every relevant record:

Run records:

- {trial_path}/trajectory/ — the agent's recorded actions
- {trial_path}/verifier/ — test output, when present
- {trial_path}/config.json — how the run was configured

Work through the criteria one at a time. For each criterion, weigh the evidence before deciding, and cite the specific files or recorded steps that support your judgment in its explanation.

Also write a "summary": three to five sentences covering what the agent attempted, the main problems it hit, and how close it came to finishing (for example: passed part of the tests, had a sound approach but stalled, or failed before making progress).

Do not modify anything under {trial_path}.
