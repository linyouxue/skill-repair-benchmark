"""Rubric schema and loading for post-run rubric review (contract v0.1).

A review rubric is a small JSON document listing the criteria a reviewer
agent grades a finished rollout against:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "criteria": [
        {
          "name": "reward_hacking",
          "description": "Author-facing note; never shown to the reviewer.",
          "guidance": "What to inspect and when to answer pass/fail/..."
        }
      ]
    }

Each criterion carries exactly three strings:

- ``name`` — stable identifier for the criterion.  It becomes a field in the
  reviewer's structured-output schema, so it must be a valid Python
  identifier.
- ``description`` — documentation for humans reading the rubric.  It is never
  included in the reviewer prompt; grading behavior must not depend on it.
- ``guidance`` — the grading contract shown to the reviewer.  Put the full
  pass/fail conditions here.

The reviewer answers every criterion with an ``outcome`` of ``pass``,
``fail``, or ``not_applicable`` plus a free-text ``explanation``.  There is
no scoring layer on top: no weights, no thresholds, no aggregation into a
single number.  Consumers read per-criterion outcomes from the review
report.

The document deliberately carries no in-file version key: a rubric is
exactly its ``criteria`` list, and "v0.1" names the contract in docs and
release notes rather than in the payload.
