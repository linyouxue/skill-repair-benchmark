Use the direct inputs, direct consumers, task constraints, and downstream

compatible with those causes; do not claim that one local edit is sufficient.

Before writing the patch, fill `diagnosis`, `expected_output_contract`,
`behavioral_invariant`, and `evidence_used`. Check not only the output type but
also output length, ordering, repetition/cycling, filtering, and boundary cases
shown by every test. The repaired step must satisfy the stated contract and
invariant. If the patch disagrees with either, revise the patch rather than
weakening the evidence.
