# Requirements for Outputs

## All Excel files

### Zero Formula Errors
- Every Excel model MUST be delivered with ZERO formula errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #N/A, #NAME?)

### Preserve Existing Templates (when updating templates)
- Study and EXACTLY match existing format, style, and conventions when modifying files
- Never impose standardized formatting on files with established patterns
- Existing template conventions ALWAYS override these guidelines

## Financial models

### Color Coding Standards
Unless otherwise stated by the user or existing template

#### Industry-Standard Color Conventions
- **Blue text (RGB: 0,0,255)**: Hardcoded inputs, and numbers users will change for scenarios
- **Black text (RGB: 0,0,0)**: ALL formulas and calculations
- **Green text (RGB: 0,128,0)**: Links pulling from other worksheets within same workbook
- **Red text (RGB: 255,0,0)**: External links to other files
- **Yellow background (RGB: 255,255,0)**: Key assumptions needing attention or cells that need to be updated

### Number Formatting Standards

#### Required Format Rules
- **Years**: Format as text strings (e.g., "2024" not "2,024")
- **Currency**: Use $#,##0 format; ALWAYS specify units in headers ("Revenue ($mm)")
- **Zeros**: Use number formatting to make all zeros "-", including percentages (e.g., "$#,##0;($#,##0);-")
- **Percentages**: Default to 0.0% format (one decimal)
- **Multiples**: Format as 0.0x for valuation multiples (EV/EBITDA, P/E)
- **Negative numbers**: Use parentheses (123) not minus -123

### Formula Construction Rules

#### Assumptions Placement
- Place ALL assumptions (growth rates, margins, multiples, etc.) in separate assumption cells
- Use cell references instead of hardcoded values in formulas
- Example: Use =B5*(1+$B$6) instead of =B5*1.05

#### Formula Error Prevention
- Verify all cell references are correct
- Check for off-by-one errors in ranges
- Ensure consistent formulas across all projection periods
- Test with edge cases (zero values, negative numbers)
- Verify no unintended circular references

#### Documentation Requirements for Hardcodes
- Comment or in cells beside (if end of table). Format: "Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Specific Reference], [URL if applicable]"
- Examples:
  - "Source: Company 10-K, FY2024, Page 45, Revenue Note, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Company 10-Q, Q2 2025, Exhibit 99.1, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Bloomberg Terminal, 8/15/2025, AAPL US Equity"
  - "Source: FactSet, 8/20/2025, Consensus Estimates Screen"

# XLSX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of an .xlsx file. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

## Important Requirements

**LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the `recalc.py` script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run

## Reading and analyzing data

### Data analysis with pandas
For data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read Excel
df = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx')  # Default: first sheet
all_sheets = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', sheet_name=None)  # All sheets as dict

# Analyze
df.head()      # Preview data
df.info()      # Column info
df.describe()  # Statistics

# Write Excel
df.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)
```

## Excel File Workflows

## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values

**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.

### ❌ WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values
```python
# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result
total = df['Sales'].sum()
sheet['B10'] = total  # Hardcodes 5000

# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python
growth = (df.iloc[-1]['Revenue'] - df.iloc[0]['Revenue']) / df.iloc[0]['Revenue']
sheet['C5'] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15

# Bad: Python calculation for average
avg = sum(values) / len(values)
sheet['D20'] = avg  # Hardcodes 42.5
```

### ✅ CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas
```python
# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum
sheet['B10'] = '=SUM(B2:B9)'

# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula
sheet['C5'] = '=(C4-C2)/C2'

# Good: Average using Excel function
sheet['D20'] = '=AVERAGE(D2:D19)'
```

This applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes.

## Common Workflow
1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting
2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file
3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting
4. **Save**: Write to file
5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the recalc.py script
   ```bash
   python recalc.py output.xlsx
   ```
6. **Verify and fix any errors**:
   - The script returns JSON with error details
   - If `status` is `errors_found`, check `error_summary` for specific error types and locations
   - Fix the identified errors and recalculate again
   - Common errors to fix:
     - `#REF!`: Invalid cell references
     - `#DIV/0!`: Division by zero
     - `#VALUE!`: Wrong data type in formula
     - `#NAME?`: Unrecognized formula name

### Creating new Excel files

```python
# Using openpyxl for formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import Workbook
from openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill, Alignment

wb = Workbook()
sheet = wb.active

# Add data
sheet['A1'] = 'Hello'
sheet['B1'] = 'World'
sheet.append(['Row', 'of', 'data'])

# Add formula
sheet['B2'] = '=SUM(A1:A10)'

# Formatting
sheet['A1'].font = Font(bold=True, color='FF0000')
sheet['A1'].fill = PatternFill('solid', start_color='FFFF00')
sheet['A1'].alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center')

# Column width
sheet.column_dimensions['A'].width = 20

wb.save('output.xlsx')
```

### Editing existing Excel files

```python
# Using openpyxl to preserve formulas and formatting
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load existing file
wb = load_workbook('existing.xlsx')
sheet = wb.active  # or wb['SheetName'] for specific sheet

# Working with multiple sheets
for sheet_name in wb.sheetnames:
    sheet = wb[sheet_name]
    print(f"Sheet: {sheet_name}")

# Modify cells
sheet['A1'] = 'New Value'
sheet.insert_rows(2)  # Insert row at position 2
sheet.delete_cols(3)  # Delete column 3

# Add new sheet
new_sheet = wb.create_sheet('NewSheet')
new_sheet['A1'] = 'Data'

wb.save('modified.xlsx')
```

## Recalculating formulas

Excel files created or modified by openpyxl contain formulas as strings but not calculated values. Use the provided `recalc.py` script to recalculate formulas:

```bash
python recalc.py <excel_file> [timeout_seconds]
```

Example:
```bash
python recalc.py output.xlsx 30
```

The script:
- Automatically sets up LibreOffice macro on first run
- Recalculates all formulas in all sheets
- Scans ALL cells for Excel errors (#REF!, #DIV/0!, etc.)
- Returns JSON with detailed error locations and counts
- Works on both Linux and macOS

## Formula Verification Checklist

Quick checks to ensure formulas work correctly:

### Essential Verification
- [ ] **Test 2-3 sample references**: Verify they pull correct values before building full model
- [ ] **Column mapping**: Confirm Excel columns match (e.g., column 64 = BL, not BK)
- [ ] **Row offset**: Remember Excel rows are 1-indexed (DataFrame row 5 = Excel row 6)

### Common Pitfalls
- [ ] **NaN handling**: Check for null values with `pd.notna()`
- [ ] **Far-right columns**: FY data often in columns 50+
- [ ] **Multiple matches**: Search all occurrences, not just first
- [ ] **Division by zero**: Check denominators before using `/` in formulas (#DIV/0!)
- [ ] **Wrong references**: Verify all cell references point to intended cells (#REF!)
- [ ] **Cross-sheet references**: Use correct format (Sheet1!A1) for linking sheets

### Formula Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Start small**: Test formulas on 2-3 cells before applying broadly
- [ ] **Verify dependencies**: Check all cells referenced in formulas exist
- [ ] **Test edge cases**: Include zero, negative, and very large values

### Interpreting recalc.py Output
The script returns JSON with error details:
```json
{
  "status": "success",           // or "errors_found"
  "total_errors": 0,              // Total error count
  "total_formulas": 42,           // Number of formulas in file
  "error_summary": {              // Only present if errors found
    "#REF!": {
      "count": 2,
      "locations": ["Sheet1!B5", "Sheet1!C10"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Library Selection
- **pandas**: Best for data analysis, bulk operations, and simple data export
- **openpyxl**: Best for complex formatting, formulas, and Excel-specific features

### Working with openpyxl
- Cell indices are 1-based (row=1, column=1 refers to cell A1)
- Use `data_only=True` to read calculated values: `load_workbook('file.xlsx', data_only=True)`
- **Warning**: If opened with `data_only=True` and saved, formulas are replaced with values and permanently lost
- For large files: Use `read_only=True` for reading or `write_only=True` for writing
- Formulas are preserved but not evaluated - use recalc.py to update values

### Working with pandas
- Specify data types to avoid inference issues: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', dtype={'id': str})`
- For large files, read specific columns: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', usecols=['A', 'C', 'E'])`
- Handle dates properly: `pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', parse_dates=['date_column'])`

## Code Style Guidelines
**IMPORTANT**: When generating Python code for Excel operations:
- Write minimal, concise Python code without unnecessary comments
- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations
- Avoid unnecessary print statements

**For Excel files themselves**:
- Add comments to cells with complex formulas or important assumptions
- Document data sources for hardcoded values
- Include notes for key calculations and model sections



## Complex Macroeconomic Economic-Model Workflow

For a multi-sheet economic model such as an investment-shock, Cobb-Douglas, or HP-filter analysis, follow this workflow in the provided workbook rather than rebuilding it:

1. **Inspect and preserve the template before editing.** Inspect every worksheet, including hidden or metadata sheets, and inventory sheet names, used ranges, year labels, row labels, existing formulas, named ranges, number formats, colors, units, merged cells, designated input areas, and placeholder columns. Preserve sheet names, layout, row and column conventions, formulas, formatting, and existing workbook structure. Do not insert, rename, or delete structural elements unless the task explicitly requires it. Separate an unavailable browser, network, Solver, or recalculation service from an actual workbook-quality failure.

2. **Collect observations only into designated input cells.** Use the specified source systems and the workbook's metadata to select the correct variables: read PWT metadata before choosing capital, output, or related series; use the IMF WEO series and vintage requested for real GDP level and real GDP growth; and use ECB annual consumption-of-fixed-capital data for the requested country. Document each hardcoded source observation in a nearby note/comment or source field with source URL, retrieval date or vintage, country, frequency, precise variable definition, units, and any transformation. Hardcoded cells are permitted only for source observations and explicit assumptions in designated input areas; do not use Python or other external calculations to substitute derived workbook values.

3. **Align data before linking sheets.** Reconcile year coverage, country, frequency, definitions, units, scale, and signs across PWT, WEO, ECB, Investment, and Production. Handle missing observations deliberately and visibly; never silently shift a year or fill a missing value with an undocumented constant. Link source observations between sheets with formulas where the value already exists in the workbook. Use formula-driven calculations for depreciation (including capital-stock linkage and the consumption-of-fixed-capital ratio), the recent-year average depreciation assumption, logarithms of capital and output, K/Y ratios, and all projections. Use compatible functions such as `LN`, `AVERAGE`, and `TREND`; guard denominators and logarithm inputs against zero or invalid values without masking genuine missing data.

4. **Build the production and forecast relationships with formulas.** Extend the real-GDP series from the requested terminal growth assumption through the full forecast horizon using cell references, not hardcoded calculated values. Extend capital using the fixed recent-year K/Y anchor specified by the task, and calculate the anchor from the appropriate recent observations with an Excel formula. Construct Cobb-Douglas potential output from the HP trend, observed or extended output inputs, capital, and the capital share; calculate investment-driven delta-K, K with the shock, counterfactual or shocked output, and forecast rows through the required horizon using linked formulas. Ensure every historical and forecast year has the intended formula and consistent units and scale.

5. **Implement the HP filter transparently in the workbook.** Link observed `LnZ` to the designated input/placeholder column and duplicate it into the designated trend range as the initial `LnZ_HP` placeholder, so the initial residual or `LnA-Trend` sanity-check column is zero before optimization. Calculate residuals and second-order differences from adjacent trend cells. Define the objective as the sum of squared residuals plus lambda times the sum of squared second differences, with lambda linked to its designated assumption cell. Configure Excel Solver, or LibreOffice Solver/NLPSolver where Excel is unavailable, to minimize the objective by changing only the designated trend range. Use a smooth nonlinear or equivalent appropriate solver, avoid circular references, and never replace the optimized trend formulas or inputs with static calculated values. Preserve formulas and make the setup understandable to a reviewer.

6. **Recalculate and validate the delivered workbook.** Save the workbook after recalculation in Excel or LibreOffice so formula cached values are available to automated checks; do not save a `data_only`-loaded workbook over the formula-bearing file. Check every sheet and every historical and forecast period for zero formula errors (`#REF!`, `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, `#N/A`, `#NAME?`), complete year coverage, correct forecast horizon, valid missing-data handling, consistent units and scale, intact cross-sheet links, no broken external links or circular references, and preserved formatting. Verify sample links and formulas before filling ranges, confirm the HP objective and trend/residual outputs are sensible, confirm the initial HP residual sanity check, and confirm the required Solver-adjusted trend remains present after save and recalculation. If recalculation or Solver cannot run because of infrastructure, report that separately from any detected workbook defect and retain formulas rather than hardcoding fallback results.
