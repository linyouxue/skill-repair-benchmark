"""Gateway must forward agent-sent reasoning params on completions routes.

Live capture (2026-08-08, proxy between the gateway and api.deepseek.com):
prime-agent sent ``thinking: {"type": "enabled"}`` + ``reasoning_effort: high``
and the upstream received neither — LiteLLM's global ``drop_params: True``
strips non-vanilla-OpenAI fields on ``openai/`` passthrough routes, so every
gateway-routed run silently used the provider's default thinking config while
a native run used the agent's. The route now allowlists the reasoning params;
an upstream that does not support them rejects them exactly as it would for a
native client, which is the parity-correct behavior.
